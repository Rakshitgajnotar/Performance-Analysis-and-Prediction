# Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction
Built a machine learning model to analyze and predict player performance using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for reliable predictions.
